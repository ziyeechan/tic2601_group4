# Getting Started

To run this project, ensure that:
<br/>

- All the necessary dependencies has been installed
- SQLite has been set up
  <br/>
  - This can be done so by installing sqlite and using the "makan_time.db" file as the database.
  - Alternatively, run the "database_dump" file to create all the necessary tables

## Navigating the Project:

### In the backend folder:

1. index.js: main file where connection is established for the project and all the generic configurations are done here
2. database folder: contains seeder file where it populates the database with the necessary data for the project
3. src folder:
  - routes.js: centralized folder for all API endpoint routes to allow frontend to call the respective endpoints
  - schemas folder: contains the initialization script for different tables used for the project
  - models folder: contains the sequelize queries for sqlite (SQL query equivalent)
  - controllers folder: contains individual endpoint

<br/>
<br/>

**Folder Structure Flow**:

- schemas folder would create the different tables -> seeder file in database folder would populate the tables with dummy data
- index.js would start up the project
- When endpoints are called,
  - First goes through routes.js to find respective endpoint called -> controllers folder to execute said endpoint -> models folder to run the respective SQL query\

### In the frontend folder:
